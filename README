** Running the application
* In order to run the application these CPAN modules need to be installed

Net::Twitter
Test::More
Test::MockObject
Gearman::Server
DBD::mysql
Moose
MooseX::Traits
DBIx::Class
YAML::XS

* A MySql DB is required with a database called 'tweets'. Run the following command in order to create it:

delimiter $$

CREATE DATABASE `tweets` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 */$$

* The dump of the schema needs to be imported (db_dump.sql file)
* The credentials in Dispatcher::Store might be changed. They're set in DB::Schema->connect()

* To start the application:
- start Gearmand
gearmand -d

- start workers
perl workers/worker_fetch_url.pl
perl workers/worker_store.pl

-start application
perl start.pl

* Some output will explain what is going on. In the DB will be possible to see the import of some data of tweets (Tweet table)

** Running tests
* This command will run the test suite:

prove -r -vvv t/

** Considerations

Due to a lack of time the application is not ideal and there is a lot to improve. Here a list of the major improvementes required
* There are some TODO and XXX in the code to explain improvements
* All the configurations are hard coded (DB, twitter uesr name, ...). Not nice...not a single instace id the DB connnection for example!
* Classes for the workers haven't been implemented...at the moment the workers are just simple script under the workers directory
* The tests are not mocking the Gearman service!!!...This is not nice but I have preferred to have a tests in place even if not proper unit one.
* There are no tests for Dispatcher::Store...not really a TDD approach for this part of the code unfortunately :(
* I haven't spent time implementing a complex DB, I have preferred to focus on the scalability of the system
